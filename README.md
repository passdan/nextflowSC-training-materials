# Physalia Introduction to Nextflow 2025

Instructor: Dr. Daniel Pass, Compass Bioinformatics

Welcome to the course! In this github repository we have a range of materials which we are going to use over this three day course:
1. This overview of the course and materials
2. The introduction to Nextflow teaching materials prepared by the Nextflow Developers & Software Carpentry team (of which this project is a fork of). [See their full summary here](README-orig.md)
3. Additional links to documentation, code examples, and exercises
4. Links to presentations & further materials
5. ["Correct" answers](episodes/files/scripts) to the workshop exercises
